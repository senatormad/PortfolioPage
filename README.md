<h1>Portfolio Page</h1>

<p>I've freshened up my old portfolio page, using old page's WordPress API, project was done without frameworks from scratch.</p>
<p>Interesting stuff written with JavaScript (that would normally be done with some framework):<p>
<ul>
  <li>WP API connection and data handling</li>
  <li>WP posts data sorting by tags (in my case projects by skills)</li>
  <li>Various small effects</li>
</ul>
